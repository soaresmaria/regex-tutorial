# Regex-Tutorial

A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

## Summary

Matching an Email- /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
Regex. There are some tricky concepts to understand, but regular expressions can do some pretty incredible things. Here we will look at a particular example that of matching an email using regular expression. Then we will move on to breaking down components of regular expressions. 

* Caret ^ - the beginning of a string
* () captures a group
* $ - end of string or line
* [] character set
* a-z matches a character between a-z
* 0-9 matches a character between 0-9
* underscore = underscore
* . is an escape character
* = - dash = dash
match one or more than one of the tokens

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters, but that assert something about the string or the matching process. Anchors assert that the engine's current position in the string matches a well-determined location: for instance, the beginning of the string, or the end of a line.
Anchors include symbols like a caret and a dollar sign at the end of the string or \A letter to describe word boundaries or lack thereof. The \letter means being a or end of a string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers in regex include ?,*, +, and then items within curly braces/brackets.
With quantifiers, you are basically trying to find how many times something happens or how many of certain things there are.
It can operate within a group, or on a whole expression. The patterns will be tested in order.

### OR Operator

* `|` Acts like a boolean OR. Matches the expression before or after the |.
It can operate within a group, or on a whole expression. The patterns will be tested in order. Just as in java will match either set of characters. It will look for this OR that.

### Character Classes

Character classes match a character from a specific set. There are a number of predefined character classes and you can also define your own sets as mentioned below.

* `[ABC]` Characters inside brakets will match any character in the set.
* `[^ABC]` Adding a caret will match any character that is not in the set.
* `[A-Z]` Add a dash between two characters will select a Range.

### Flags

Expression flags change how the expression is interpreted. Flags follow the closing forward slash of the expression.

* `i` Ignores case
* `g` Global search retain the index of the last match, allowing subsequent searches to start from the end of the previous match. Without the global flag, subsequent searches will return the same match.
* `m` Multiline flag When the multiline flag is enabled, beginning and end anchors (^ and $) will match the start and end of a line, instead of the start and end of the whole string.
* `u` Unicode
* `y` The expression will only match from its lastIndex position and ignores the global (g) flag if set. Because each search in RegExr is discrete, this flag has no further impact on the displayed results.
* `s` Dot (.) will match any character, including newline.

### Grouping and Capturing

* `(ABC)` Capturing groups multiple tokens together and creates a capture group for extracting a substring or using a backreference.
* `(?<name>ABC)` named capturing group captures groups of a specific name.
* `\1` is a numeric Referance
* `(?:ABC)` Groups multiple tokens together without creating a capture group.

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
